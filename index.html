          "I have lived In San Diego for 26 years, so i can show you all of its best parts and hidden secrets that San Diego has to offer. I went to Escondido High school right out side the city, so not only can I show you the city and its beachs, but I know a ton of local spots and activities farther inland as well. Lets have a great time.
